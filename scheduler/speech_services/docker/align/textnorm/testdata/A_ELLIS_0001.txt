Madam Deputy Speaker, I move without notice: That the House â€“ notes
that 9 November 2009, commemorates the 20th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall, effectively signalling the end of the Cold War;
further notes that the fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for
German reunification, which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990;
recognises that the lessons learned from this period in history have
strong resonance in our own, also marked by strong and unnecessary
divide; calls on all members and the entire South African nation to
identify those walls that still exist in our minds, and break them
down; and recommits itself to those values that unite the nation and
urges South Africans to build on them together.
