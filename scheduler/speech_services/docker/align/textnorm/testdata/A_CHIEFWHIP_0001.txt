Hon Deputy Speaker, I move without
notice:

That the House â€“ 

notes that 3 December marks the annual observance of the International
Day of Persons Living With Disabilities and the aim of this day is to
promote an understanding of disability issues;

further notes that this day also seeks to increase awareness about gains
that are derived from the integration of persons living with
disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic and cultural
life;

acknowledges that persons living with disabilities continue to face
barriers to their participation in society and are often forced to live
on the margins of society;

believes that dignity and justice for all persons are universal
principles, and the rights of all members of the human family form the
foundations of freedom, equality and justice for all, and peace in the
world; and

commits itself on this day, to the creation of an ever-expanding
frontier of the dignity of people living with disabilities, since the
achievement of that dignity, for this section of our society, should be
predicated on the freedom of the individual to determine his or her
destiny.
