Madam Deputy Speaker, I move without notice:

That the House â€“ 

notes with profound sadness the passing away of comrade Eleanor Kasrils
on Sunday 8 November 2009;

further notes that she was a committed fighter in the struggle to end
apartheid and to work for a non-racial, democratic South Africa;

acknowledges that her devotion to the freedom of all the people of South
Africa led to her arrest in 1963 and that, subsequent to her escape from
custody, she went into exile where she continued to work tirelessly for
the freedom of the South African people;

remembers her tireless dedication to the liberation movement in England
and in Tanzania during her approximately 30 years in exile;

believes that her selfless contribution towards the struggle and to the
birth of the new constitutional democracy can never be fully
appreciated; and

conveys its sincere condolences to her friends, comrades in the struggle
and the Kasrils family, in particular to her husband Ronnie, her
daughter Brigid and her two sons Andrew and Christopher.
